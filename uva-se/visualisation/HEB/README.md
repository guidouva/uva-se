hsqldb.js is required by viewer.html

It is not present in the repository because it is generated by Rascal.

To generate it open a Rascal console from the project (uva-se). Then do:

```
import lang::java::m3::Core;
import AstCloneDetector;
hsqldb = createM3FromEclipseProject(|project://hsqldb-2.3.1|);
writeClones(hsqldb.id, |file:///path-to/uva-se/visualisation/HEB/hsqldb.js|);
```

Then open viewer.html in your favorite web browser.

NOTE: you need to allocate _a lot_ of memory for Eclipse (8 GB is recommended)
if you don't want it to crash on hsqldb.
